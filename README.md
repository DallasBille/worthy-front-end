## About the Project:

The diamond form is a front and project made in congruence with a backend api, which houses an algorithm that determines the value of a diamond based on user input. A user fills out the form, which get sent to the back end, run through the alogrithm, and the value is returned.

## Motivation:

This was a code challenge that I took a bit too far, because I found it fun and interesting. I like the full stack game, and this was a cool project to get started with Node and Express.js.

## Technologies:

This is a basic react form with vanilla CSS.

## Back End:

I have an Express.js backend that sends an API, consumed by this front end. Clone this so you can test the valuator.

## Set-Up:

1. clone to local.
2. cd into file.
3. npm install.
4. npm start.

## To-Do's:

The goal is to get a back end hosted on heroku. So there is work to do on the back end. And some minor design improvements for the front.
